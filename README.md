    Detect the Price Discrepancy:

        The bot constantly monitors ARB/ETH prices on both Uniswap and SushiSwap.

        It sees that ARB is cheaper on Uniswap and more expensive on SushiSwap.

    Execute Arbitrage Trade:

        It buys ARB on Uniswap at 0.00042 ETH

        It sells ARB on SushiSwap at 0.00044 ETH

        For every ARB token traded, it profits 0.00002 ETH

    Repeat Quickly and at Scale:

        The bot repeats this across thousands of tokens or with higher volume.

        Often it uses flash loans to borrow ETH, execute arbitrage, and repayâ€”all in one transaction (zero upfront capital).

ðŸ“‰ Realistic Considerations

    Gas Fees (on Ethereum) can eat into arbitrage profits.

    Slippage must be managed.

    Latency matters â€” other bots may be competing.

    MEV (miner/maximal extractable value) bots might front-run your transaction.

âœ… TL;DR

A spatial arbitrage bot on ARB/ETH:

    Buys ARB on the cheaper DEX (e.g., Uniswap)

    Sells ARB on the costlier DEX (e.g., SushiSwap)

    Profits from ETH difference (Î” price Ã— amount)

    All done automatically, often using flash loans
